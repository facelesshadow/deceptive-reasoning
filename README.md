# deceptive-reasoning
A reasoning framework for non-reasoning models with langgraph under the hood. 

Made for smaller local non reasoning models, with Gemma3 being the best example. 

The flow itself is fairly straightforward for now, as it is only the most basic running flow.

The scope for improvements is immense and I plan to scale it further, and of course optimize it to reserve the least number of tokens for the graph.
