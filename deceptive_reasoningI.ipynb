      "content='AI is rapidly transforming the military landscape, with significant applications in areas like surveillance, defense, logistics, intelligence, and cyber warfare. Currently, AI is being utilized to enhance data analysis, automate tasks, and improve decision-making across various military operations. Specifically, itâ€™s being used to gather intelligence, optimize logistics, and bolster cybersecurity.  The military is exploring how AI can improve situational awareness, streamline operations, and potentially automate certain tasks.  While the full extent of AIâ€™s impact remains to be seen, its potential to reshape military strategy is considerable.\\n\\nTo provide a comprehensive overview, weâ€™ll focus on practical applications and key areas where AI is currently being employed.  AI is currently being used to enhance intelligence gathering, optimize logistics, and bolster cybersecurity.  Itâ€™s also being utilized in areas like autonomous systems, which are designed to operate without direct human control.  The integration of AI is expected to continue growing, with significant implications for future military operations.\\n\\nNext steps would involve exploring specific examples of AIâ€™s current use in different military domains and examining the ongoing evolution of AI within the military sector.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'gemma3:1b', 'created_at': '2025-08-14T05:46:10.414708Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 14909836700, 'load_duration': 688414400, 'prompt_eval_count': 1227, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1929296600, 'eval_count': 228, 'eval_duration': 12289236900, 'model_name': 'gemma3:1b'} id='run--70f97cff-bf1e-45fb-9cd8-b57842b89a63-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 1227, 'output_tokens': 228, 'total_tokens': 1455}\n"
